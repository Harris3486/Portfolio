            <h3> Project 1 - Python NBA Top 75 Trivia </h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Overview - Single question, randomized trivia about the top 75 players in the NBA all-time list.

            <p style="text-align: center;">
                I wanted to create a trivia containing one question, that can have different answers each loop.
                I thought to use the list of the top 75 players, and display two types of information to the
                user: the amount of points scored by a specific player, and the teams they have played for.
                After doing this 5 times, the loop ends and shows the user how many they got correct out of 5.
                During the loop, if a user gets a question wrong, it will display who the correct player is.
                The user can also type in lowercase, or uppercase.
            </p>

        <h3> Project 2 - Python Spotify Data Analysis </h3>
        <div class="center">
            <p> Overview - Analyzing Spotify personal data using Pandas and Matplotib. To obtain streaming history, download
                personal data from Spotify USA Inc. Analysis of data pertaining to singular artist, in this case
                Mac Miller and my personal data. NOTE: My personal data is not uploaded in my repository on Github. You
                will have to download your own data by reaching out to Spotify to request your data. </p>

                <img src="spotify.JPG" alt="Spotify Python Code" >
            </div>
            <p> I analyzed my data pertaining to music I listened to, but specifically Mac Miller music. I chose this
                artist because I often listen to him. I was able to produce to different graphs.

        </div>
        <div class="center">
        <p>The first chart of the top pertains to the frequency of Mac Miller songs I listened to each day. On Tuesday's
        and Fridays I listened more often. The second chart on the bottom pertains to the frequency of Mac Miller songs I
        listened to by hour. It makes sense that I didn't listen to music much from 3 AM - 7 AM. I listened the most at
        12PM, and often from 9PM-11PM. This project helped me learn how to display data in a visual way, and
        how to obtain specific information from data.</p>
        <h3 id="resume"> Project 3 - HTML Create a website! </h3>
        <p> Learning HTML to display my new projects, resume, and document my Python journey with my friend Ashley is a
        great way to show off our skills! I started to learn HTML to make this website you are reading from right now. If
        you wish to see how my HTML works, right-click on the page and click "View Page Source"</p>

            <p> Welcome to my first website! My name is Harris Mohammad. I wanted to keep learning after undergrad, so my friend
                Ashley and I started learning Python amd HTML. We update each other on our progress on projects, or new ideas
                we are learning. You can see some of the progress I've made as I have been learning with Ashley. Check out my
                projects, my resume, or the HTML source code! Also check out my <a href="https://github.com/Harris3486" target="_blank">Github!</a>
